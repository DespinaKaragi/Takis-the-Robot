# Takis-the-Robot
A simple C++ robot simulation program where 'Takis the Robot' performs various actions like moving, turning, greeting, and recharging, all while managing battery consumption. The robotâ€™s callsign is initialized by the user, and actions are restricted if battery levels are low, triggering automatic recharging.
