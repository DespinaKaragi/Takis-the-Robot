# Takis-the-Robot
A simple C++ robot simulation program where 'Takis the Robot' performs various actions like moving, turning, greeting, and recharging, all while managing battery consumption. The robotâ€™s callsign is initialized by the user, and actions are restricted if battery levels are low, triggering automatic recharging.

## Features
- **Customizable Callsign:** The robot's nickname is input by the user during initialization.
- **Battery Management:** The robot has a starting battery of 500 units. Each action consumes battery, and the robot will recharge automatically when the battery drops below 50 units.
- **Movement and Actions:** 
  - Move forward (cost: 100 units)
  - Turn left (cost: 50 units)
  - Turn right (cost: 50 units)
  - Say hello with the robot's callsign (cost: 75 units)
  - Recharge (+300 units)

## Technologies Used
- **C++:** The program is implemented in C++.
- **Standard Input/Output:** User interaction via console.
